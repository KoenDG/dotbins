Introducing `dotbins` - a utility for managing CLI tool binaries in your dotfiles repository. It downloads and organizes binaries for popular tools across multiple platforms (macOS, Linux) and architectures (amd64, arm64), helping you maintain a consistent set of CLI utilities across all your environments.

Whether you work across multiple machines or just want a version-controlled setup for your essential command-line tools, dotbins makes it easy to keep everything synchronized and updated. üöÄ

## :books: Usage

To use `dotbins`, you'll need to familiarize yourself with its commands:

```bash
dotbins --help
```

<!-- CODE:BASH:START -->
<!-- echo '```bash' -->
<!-- dotbins --help -->
<!-- echo '```' -->
<!-- CODE:END -->

<!-- ‚ö†Ô∏è This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
```bash
usage: dotbins [-h] [-v] [--tools-dir TOOLS_DIR]
               {list,update,init,analyze} ...

dotbins - Manage CLI tool binaries in your dotfiles repository

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose         Enable verbose output
  --tools-dir TOOLS_DIR
                        Tools directory (default: ~/.dotfiles/tools)

Command to execute:
  {list,update,init,analyze}
    list                List available tools
    update              Update tools
    init                Initialize directory structure
    analyze             Analyze GitHub releases for a tool
```
<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

### Commands

1. **init** - Initialize the tools directory structure
2. **list** - List available tools defined in your configuration
3. **update** - Download or update tools
4. **analyze** - Analyze GitHub releases to help configure new tools

## :hammer_and_wrench: Installation

To install `dotbins`, simply use pip:

```bash
pip install dotbins
```

You'll also need to create or update your `tools.yaml` configuration file either in the same directory as the script or at a custom location specified with `--tools-dir`.

## :gear: Configuration

dotbins uses a YAML configuration file (`tools.yaml`) to define the tools and settings:

```yaml
# Configuration
dotfiles_dir: ~/.dotfiles
tools_dir: ~/.dotfiles/tools

# Target platforms and architectures
platforms:
  - linux
  - macos
architectures:
  - amd64
  - arm64

# Tool definitions
tools:
  fzf:
    repo: junegunn/fzf
    extract_binary: true
    binary_name: fzf
    binary_path: fzf  # The binary is directly in the root of the archive
    asset_pattern: fzf-{version}-{platform}_{arch}.tar.gz
    platform_map: macos:darwin
```

Each tool definition includes:
- **repo**: GitHub repository in the format owner/repo
- **extract_binary**: Whether to extract from an archive (true) or download directly (false)
- **binary_name**: Name of the resulting binary
- **binary_path**: Path to the binary within the archive
- **asset_pattern**: Pattern to match the GitHub release asset
- **platform_map**: Optional mapping between dotbins platform names and the tool's naming

## :bulb: Examples

List available tools:
```bash
dotbins list
```

Update all tools for all platforms:
```bash
dotbins update
```

Update specific tools only:
```bash
dotbins update fzf bat
```

Update tools for a specific platform/architecture:
```bash
dotbins update -p macos -a arm64
```

Analyze a GitHub repository to help configure a new tool:
```bash
dotbins analyze owner/repo
```

## :computer: Shell Integration

Add this to your shell configuration file (e.g., .bashrc, .zshrc) to use the platform-specific binaries:

```bash
# dotbins - Add platform-specific binaries to PATH
_os=$(uname -s | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')
[[ "$_os" == "darwin" ]] && _os="macos"

_arch=$(uname -m)
[[ "$_arch" == "x86_64" ]] && _arch="amd64"
[[ "$_arch" == "aarch64" || "$_arch" == "arm64" ]] && _arch="arm64"

export PATH="$HOME/.dotfiles/tools/$_os/$_arch/bin:$PATH"
```

## :mag: Finding Tool Patterns

To add a new tool, you can use the `analyze` command to examine GitHub release assets:

```bash
dotbins analyze sharkdp/bat
```

This will suggest a configuration for the tool based on its release assets.
